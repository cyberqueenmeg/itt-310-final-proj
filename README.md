# ITT-310 Final Project

This is my final project for ITT-310, also known as Programming for Security Professionals, at Grand Canyon University. This course is an introduction to the C programming language.

For my final project, I created a modified Caesar cipher. It utilizes a scrambled alphabet to encode and decode messages from the command line.

This program runs on Windows and was created using Visual Studio Enterprise
